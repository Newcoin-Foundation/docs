# What is Newcoin?


## Basics

Newcoin is a design-aware Layer-1 Blockchain, characterized by its community-implemented and community-audited smart contracts. 

Because smart contracts are provided by the blockchain, app developers can get access to them for free and do not need to worry about auditing. 

Sharing the same smart contracts across the same blockchain also means that the blockchain is built for interoperability and that all dApps running on the Newcoin Blockchain share the same content, services & users.

The Newcoin ecosystem also provides a range of services to help you kick off your idea quickly, such as a searchable graph database called Newgraph, a list of Newcoin compatible API's at Newstack and a Frontend UI SDK at IOSDK.
