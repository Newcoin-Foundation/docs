# What is Newcoin?


## Basics

Newcoin is a design-aware Layer-1 Blockchain, where all smart contracts are implemented and audited by the community. 

Additionally, Newcoin also provides with newgraph a searchable graph database

Due to this, all Blockchain content is shared between all dApps running on Newcoin
    
Most Blockchains are turing complete general purpose and therefore design-agnostic. 

Newcoin has standardized smart contracts are either running on the system layer or on a monitored virtual machine, and deployed according to the will of the community through the MainDAO. 

The blockchain is therefore aware of its own capabilities at a system-level, which enables more interoperability through an open standardization process and integrated mechanism design between the consensus algorithm and real world applications.
