# What is Newprotocol?


## Basics

Newprotocol is a design-aware Layer-1 Blockchain, where all smart contracts are implemented and audited by the community. 

Additionally, Newprotocol also provides with newgraph a searchable graph database

Due to this, all Blockchain content is shared between all dApps running on Newprotocol

Most Blockchains are turing complete general purpose and therefore design-agnostic. 

Newprotocol has standardized smart contracts are either running on the system layer or on a monitored virtual machine, and deployed according to the will of the community through the MainDAO. 

The blockchain is therefore aware of its own capabilities at a system-level, which enables more interoperability through an open standardization process and integrated mechanism design between the consensus algorithm and real world applications.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
